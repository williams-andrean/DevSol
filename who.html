						<h1>Who I Am</h1>
						<p>Hey everyone, Andrea here.</p> 

<p>I thought I would share a bit of my story to give you an idea of who I am and why I do what I do. Having grown up around tech, my interest was out of curiosity at first. I really just wanted to learn how it all worked to make my life as a student easier. However the more I learned, the harder it was to resist the urge to learn more. I was lucky enough to go to a middle school (and later a high school) that offered a few computer courses. It was in middle school that I took my very first web design class. It was my introduction to HTML &amp; CSS and after that, I was hooked. I became addicted to messing around with the web and creating my own silly profiles on sites that interested me as a teen.</p>

<p>After that first course I randomly decided that taking an intro to Python class was a good idea. I have no idea what I had been thinking... I have nothing against Python but I had never been more bored in my life. During an entire semester, we only created one project that I can remember clearly. It was a silly form that asked the same questions that appeared in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail where the knights reach the bridge with the creepy old man at the end. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out! Anyway, I don't think my boredom was from learning Python. I believe it was from the slower pace of the class. I could see the potential that even basic programming knowledge brings and was frustrated that there wasn't more for me to work on. </p>

<p>Looking back on that experience now, I can see why it happened that way. I tend to learn at a quicker pace than most so when I have to slow down it becomes frustrating. That is the primary reason that I am self taught. I tend to accomplish more on my own than I would in a classroom setting and I can tailor my learning path so that it works better for me. </p>

<p>My next experience with web development happened in high school. There were two web design classes and remembering how much I enjoyed the class I took in middle school, I signed up for both of them one after the other. These classes were more focused on on using Dreamweaver and photo editing in Fireworks. While I appreciate the more design focused learning experience these courses provided, I prefer hand written code for my development projects now. </p>

<p>My goal is to become as well rounded a developer as possible, or what some might call a full-stack developer. To put it simply, I want to be able to work with both front-end and back-end technologies when it comes to web development. This process will take time and it is my hope that writing about my journey through the expansive land of development will help you on your own journey, where ever it may take you! </p>

<p>â€‹-Andrea</p>
